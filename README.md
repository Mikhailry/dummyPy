# dummyPy
A python module to transform categorical variables to one hot encoded vectors. It particularly handles categorical variables of a dataset that cannot be fit into memory.

You can find a small tutorial in [this](https://yashuseth.wordpress.com/2017/12/14/how-to-one-hot-encode-categorical-variables-of-a-large-dataset-in-python/) blog post.

Any issue/bug reports or feature requests are greatly appreciated.
